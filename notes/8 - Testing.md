## Using Jest and Enzyme

- jest test globals
- Shallow rendering

## Unit Testing

- Edge cases

## Mocking

- benefits over external APIs

Shallow
- doesnt render nested components
- only top level

Mounting
- actually dives into the content of the component
- renders spans and lis, and styled-component class name
- good bc its close to the environment the user will see

## Snapshot Testing

- updating snapshots
- how snapshots work
